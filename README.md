#🚀 SmartSelect+ — AI-Powered Candidate Screening System

Multi-Agent System | Built during AgentX Hackathon 2025

SmartSelect+ is an AI-driven platform designed to automate the screening and evaluation of applicants for training programs.
The system analyzes CVs, extracts technical and soft skills, checks eligibility, ranks candidates, and provides transparent explanations for acceptance or rejection.

It functions as a fully automated multi-step workflow powered by Microsoft Copilot Studio and integrated evaluation logic.

#✨ Key Features

End-to-End Workflow: From upload → analysis → scoring → classification → recommendations.
